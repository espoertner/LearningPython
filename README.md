# LearningPython
<h2>PracticingPython.org</h2>
This folder contains practice solutions to challenges on the website PracticingPython.org.
Exuse any inconistancies in variable usage and code that could be written in fewer lines. This is the early stages of my Python learning. I'm still piecing together what ways variable/ constants/ functions/ etc. can be used and how they can be simplified.
<h3>Current solutions:</h3>
(if file name is different than exercise name, file name is in parentheses)
-Character Input (age)
-Odd Or Even
-List Less Than Ten (list)
-List Overlap
-String Lists
-List Comprehensions
-Rock Paper Scissors (simplegame)
-Guessing game one
-Check Primality Functions (checkprimality)
-List Ends
-Fibonacci
-List Remove Duplucates
-Reverse Word Order
